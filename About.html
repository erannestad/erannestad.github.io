            <p>The current work is an attempt to embody place, as well as the industrial, natural, and cultural forces a place is composed of. By combining industrial materials such as concrete, plywood, and insulation foam with cartographic maps and grown plants, the work borrows from the material landscape where it was constructed. Upon a plywood backbone, some material components adapt a measured aesthetic, while other sections show growth, process, and decay over time.  By compartmentalizing the way our environments are built, measured, and change, these paintings and sculptural installations aim to reflect the externalities and symbiotic intricacies that occur at the intersection of nature and the built environment.</p>
