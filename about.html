                <meta name="about" content="Eric Rannestad (b. 1996 - Chester, Connecticut) is a Montana-based artist making work about the systems and technology that humans use to compartmentalize, measure, and model the natural world. The current work speculates on the infrastructure of the built environment through sculpture, painting, and digital media. 

                Informed by, and conflated with, the economic, natural resource, and architectural models shaping our built environment, these projects contemplate the ‘model’ as an attempt to control the compounding crises of our present moment, and as an act of imagination. Historical conceptions of cosmologic infrastructure, market frameworks, and mapping technology inform the work’s medium, imagery, and form. 

                Eric is a Master of Design Studies (MDes - Mediums) candidate at the Harvard Graduate School of Design and received a BA in Studio Art and a BA in Economics from Whitman College. He has attended fellowships at the Vermont Studio Center and I-Park Foundation and has attended residencies at Centrum, Sitka Center for Art and Ecology, Shell House Arts, and more. Eric also completed a certificate in GIS + Design from Pratt Institute and was a participant in the 2018 New York Arts Practicum. His commercial projects in cartography and graphic design are a significant influence in his art practice.

                    Eric Rannestad (b. 1996 - Chester, Connecticut) is a Montana-based artist making work about the systems and technology that humans use to compartmentalize, measure, and model the natural world. The current work speculates on the infrastructure of the built environment through sculpture, painting, and digital media. References to atmosphere, biodomes, market systems, mapping and modeling suggest that our natural and built worlds are intertwined in a precarious system of control.

Sections of material adopt a measured and contained aesthetic, while other sections resist this unity and reflect growth, variety, and decay. The gridded and organic components of my work suggest that the natural and built worlds are intertwined but are part of a precarious system on the verge of collapse. Like a scientific or economic model, my artwork is a collection of elements: materials, data, aesthetic components -- each contributing to the built environment it comes to represent.-->
