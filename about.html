Eric received his BA in Art and Economics from Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington. He has attended fellowships and residencies at the Centrum, Sitka Center for Art and Ecology, the Vermont Studio Center, North Cascades Institute, New York Arts Practicum, and Shell House Arts. His research in environmental economics is critical to his art practice and Ericâ€™s ongoing work for environmental and conservation groups is an important influence in his work. -->
                    
                <!--The work is an effort to describe the constructed qualities of climate change and landscape. Sections of material adopt a measured and contained aesthetic, while other sections resist this unity and reflect growth, variety, and decay. The gridded and organic components of my work suggest that the natural and built worlds are intertwined but are part of a precarious system on the verge of collapse. Like a scientific or economic model, my artwork is a collection of elements: materials, data, aesthetic components -- each contributing to the built environment it comes to represent.-->
