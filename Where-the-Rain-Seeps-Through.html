                <meta name="about" content="Eric Rannestad (b. 1996 - Chester, Connecticut) is a Montana-based artist making work about the systems and technology that humans use to compartmentalize, measure, and model the natural world. The current work speculates on the infrastructure of the built environment through sculpture, painting, and digital media. References to atmosphere, biodomes, market systems, mapping and modeling suggest that our natural and built worlds are intertwined in a precarious system of control.

                Eric received his BA in Studio Art and BA in Economics from Whitman College. He has attended fellowships and residencies at Centrum, Sitka Center for Art and Ecology, the Vermont Studio Center, North Cascades Institute, New York Arts Practicum, and Shell House Arts. Eric completed a certificate in GIS + Design from the Pratt Institute. Eric works across the cartographic and graphic/web design space. His ongoing work in these areas are an important influence in his art practice.

                        Compartmentalizing the way environments are constructed, measured, and grow, <b><i>Where the Rain Seeps Through</i></b> reflects a shifting balance between the natural world and built environment. Sections of material adapt a measured and contained aesthetic, while others resist this uniformity and reflect growth, variety, and decay. This tension characterizes the erosion and eventual failure of systems used to organize and quantify our world.</p>
