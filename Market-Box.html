<!--      <h2>Market Boxes</h2>-->
          <p>The Market Box is an attempt to capture a relationship between industry and the natural world. More specifically, these boxes are an embodiment of the quantification and valuation of our natural resources. Non-market valuation techniques assign monetary value to parts of nature that are not ordinarily bought and sold within our current market system. What is the price of a standing forest? The watershed services it might provide? The value of a quiet recreation on public land? Assigning tangible monetary value to our worldâ€™s natural resources offers nature a chance to withstand the forces of industry. However, in this process, we ignore the ethical nuances and complications that arise when we try to describe our world through money and an inherently anthropocentric perspective.</p>
