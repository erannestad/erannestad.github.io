                <meta name="about" content="Eric Rannestad (b. 1996 - Chester, Connecticut) is a Montana-based artist making work about the systems and technology that humans use to compartmentalize, measure, and model the natural world. The current work speculates on the infrastructure of the built environment through sculpture, painting, and digital media. References to atmosphere, biodomes, market systems, mapping and modeling suggest that our natural and built worlds are intertwined in a precarious system of control.

                Eric received his BA in Studio Art and BA in Economics from Whitman College. He has attended fellowships and residencies at Centrum, Sitka Center for Art and Ecology, the Vermont Studio Center, North Cascades Institute, New York Arts Practicum, and Shell House Arts. Eric completed a certificate in GIS + Design from the Pratt Institute. Eric works across the cartographic and graphic/web design space. His ongoing work in these areas are an important influence in his art practice.

                    <p>The Market Box embodies a systematic quantification of the world's natural resources. Monetary values are assigned to anything -- even that which is not bought or sold within a market. We assign prices to a standing forests, the watershed services they provide, and quantify the value public land. These values are tangible to capitalist decision-making but ignore the ethical nuances and complications that arise when describing the world through money and an inherently anthropocentric perspective.
