                <meta name="about" content="Eric Rannestad (b. 1996 - Chester, Connecticut) is a Montana-based artist making work about the systems and technology that humans use to compartmentalize, measure, and model the natural world. The current work speculates on the infrastructure of the built environment through sculpture, painting, and digital media. References to atmosphere, biodomes, market systems, mapping and modeling suggest that our natural and built worlds are intertwined in a precarious system of control.

                Eric received his BA in Studio Art and BA in Economics from Whitman College. He has attended fellowships and residencies at Centrum, Sitka Center for Art and Ecology, the Vermont Studio Center, North Cascades Institute, New York Arts Practicum, and Shell House Arts. Eric completed a certificate in GIS + Design from the Pratt Institute. Eric works across the cartographic and graphic/web design space. His ongoing work in these areas are an important influence in his art practice.

                                <i>Initial Conditions</i> consists of two conceptually similar, but materially different, series of work. Brought together to show for the first time, these paintings and a sculptural installation speculate on the future infrastructure of the built environment and explore the human (in)ability to model and control complex natural systems.
                                <br><br>
                                The paintings in this show collage various watercolor rendering techniques – machine-plotting, hand-painting, lifting, washing, masking – as layers in the grid. Stacked in pictorial space are references to digital imagery, maps, contemplative renderings of ecologic space, and woven architecture of the frame.  
                                <br><br>
                                Occupying the floor of the gallery is an arched network of tanks, tubes, pumps, and nozzles. This sculptural work, part of the Firmament series, reimagines the infrastructure of various religious cosmologies as a fantastical climate infrastructure of tomorrow. Greenhouses, biodomes, and interventions in our planet’s atmosphere have become the world’s new firmament, new sublime, and precarious system of control.
