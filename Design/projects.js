        description: 'Firmament Arch is part of a growing series of work about the constructed qualities of climate change and our relationship to the natural world in the face of ecological collapse. <p class="subtext">The series reimagines cosmological structures of the past: the pillars of heaven, the firmament, the great deep, the ocean of heaven, etc. as architectural backbones of our future infrastructure and defining forces in our relationship to nature. <br><br> In religious cosmology, the sky was conceptualized as a physical structure – a firmament – that separated earth from the oceans of heavens. Firmament Arch references the architecture of our increasingly necessary biodomes and greenhouses and reimagines them as the firmament structures of tomorrow. The curved backbone of the work houses a network of tanks, tubes, pumps, and nozzles that form an aeroponic growing environment, allowing plants to grow in irregular and confined spaces with minimal water waste or reliance on natural light.</p>',

With quick, sure, sweeping movements, she showed me how to remove its scales with the back of the knife. I tried not to flinch as scales and flesh juices and residual saltwater sprayed across our clothes and faces, splattering the window and walls. She cut into its belly from anus to gills, and there was blood and egg, and the softness of intestines and stomach and heart. These innards of another creature felt both intimate and alien. “Don’t ever cut this one,” she said, her accent tilting the English as she prodded with her long fingernail some innocuous-looking organ. “You cut this, you ruin it.” <br><br> She sheared away the gills with kitchen scissors, dressed the fish with the fresh garlic and scapes and onion and ginger and salt, some green herbs from the Veranda Asian market (a dirty place, smelling faintly of bamboo and sweat, filled with hundred-pound bags of rice and piles of odd animal parts—beef tongue, chicken feet, pig ears wrapped in cellophane), and put it on a baking sheet. When the fish emerged from the oven, we tore into its smooth white flesh—I with bare fingers, she with chopsticks. Salt and ginger and the savor of meat. The pile of picked-over bones on the table grew, and when it was almost gone, I watched her pop each fish eye into her mouth, one at a time.<br><br>***<br><br>I spent much of the first five years of my life in the presence of my mother. I don’t remember much about her from that time; I cannot picture her face or her words or the way she moved.
