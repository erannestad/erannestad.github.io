It is not arduous work, unless major limbs have been smashed or mutilated. If the fall was carefully and correctly planned, the chances of anything of the kind happening will have been reduced. Again, much depends upon the size, age, shape, and species of the tree. Still, you will be lucky if you can get through this stages without having to use machinery. Even in the best of circumstances it is a labor that will make you wish often that you had won the favor of the universe of ants, the empire of mice, or at least a local tribe of squirrels, and could enlist their labors and their talents.

        imageSubtext: ["<br>OVERVIEW:<br<br><br>The Nature Conservancy has partnered with the United States Department of Agriculture’s ('USDA') Agricultural Research Service (“ARS”) and Oregon State University (“OSU”) to develop a series of native seed treatments (including coatings) and seeding protocols to address the degradation of the sagebrush steppe within the Great Basin. The combination of these elements is expected to foster a higher level of native grass, forb, and shrub germination, establishment, and survival than that achieved by current restoration practices. <br<br><br>The degradation of the sage steppe within the Great Basin, a notoriously difficult restoration problem, has been caused by a combination of invasive annual grasses, wildfires, overgrazing, human-caused land disturbances, and other factors. Because restoration sites typically differ in their characteristics (e.g., soil type, aridity, elevation, slope aspect, etc.), the assumption behind the foregoing development work is that each restoration site will require the application of differing seed treatments and seeding protocols over both their expanse and the course of their restoration. Hence, the Nature Conservancy has applied computer-based geographic information systems (“GIS”) to map the characteristics of restoration sites and to determine which seeding treatments and protocols would be most effective and exactly when and where they should be applied on a site-by-site basis. This pairing of GIS with seed treatments and protocols for rangeland restoration is called Precision Restoration by the Nature Conservancy.<br<br><br><br> OBJECTIVES OF THE REPORT <br<br><br> This Report, firstly, analyzes the market for native seed in the Great Basin and the supply chain that serves it. Specifically, the Report looks at the availability of the two types of native seed offered within the market: Native cultivar seed and locally adapted native seed. Achieving sufficient availability of the latter is called out within the very first goal of the National Seed Strategy, which states “Identify seed needs and ensure the reliable availability of genetically appropriate seed” (Plant Conservation Alliance Federal Committee. 2015). Such “reliable availability” is considered foundational to achieving the desired levels of native plant community restoration on public and private lands across the United States. The report, secondly, looks, from a high-level, at how Precision Restoration, so far as it is currently developed, provides for superior levels of germination, establishment, and survival of those native plants endemic to the Great Basin. It then recommends where it may best be positioned within the native seed supply chain and the trends currently impacting the native seed market in order to bring Precision Restoration into landscape-wide use within the Great Basin.", '','','','','','','']
