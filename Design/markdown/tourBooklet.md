### New brand assets and design system for the Walla Walla County Conservation District print and digital outreach channels.

The Tour booklet was printed and distributed to various state lawmakers, local press, and participating landowners at the Walla Walla County Conservation District’s bi-annual tour. This 22 page booklet served as a schedule and guide for that event, showcasing the organization’s recent conservation projects. The cover design references the organization’s new logo. The logo’s woven motif is expanded and abstracted to illustrate the rolling wheat fields of Walla Walla County.

The conservation district system is unique in that each district level office is governed by a local board and sets its own priorities and programs -- meaning that each conservation district is unique to the area that it serves. The Walla Walla County Conservation District wanted to reflect this by developing a unique brand system. While unique, it was also important that the design system be compatible and compliant with other conservation district styling.
