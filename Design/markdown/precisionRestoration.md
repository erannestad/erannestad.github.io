### Collection of marketing and outreach material for The Nature Conservancy's Precision Restoration Project. 

The suite includes an infographic that tells the larger story of Precision Restoration, a still and animated GIF that depicts how one of the seed treatments work, and an animated fire map that was built in ArcGIS. I worked with staff at the economic consulting firm ECONorthwest to researched write a market analysis and feasibility report for the Oregon Nature Conservancy. Market problems, trends, and supply chain of native seed are addressed. The document continues to serve as a technical appendix for the The Nature Conservancy as they bring Precision Restoration Technologies to a larger production scale.
