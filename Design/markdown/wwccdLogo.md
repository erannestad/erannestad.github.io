### A logo and style redesign for the Walla Walla County Conservation District. 

The goal of the project was to add a modern touch to the vague old logo -- a default for all conservation districts -- and turn it something unique for the Walla Walla region. The new logo incorperates the abstract simplicity of the old design, spinning the old "c" into a representation of the rolling agricultural landscape of Walla Walla County.
